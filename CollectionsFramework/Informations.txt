Important interfaces:

1. Iterable :- This is the parent interface which is extend by Collection interface. 
               It allows you to iterate over list,Set,queues via iterator or forEach.

2. Collection :- This is the main interface which provide the common functionality (add, addAll, remove etc).
                 This interface is extended by List, Set, Queue interfaces.


Iterable -> Collection -> List

3. List :- This is a child interface of the collection interface. 
           This interface is dedicated to the data of the list type in which we can store all the ordered collection of the objects.
           This also allows duplicate data to be present in it. 
           This list interface is implemented by various classes like ArrayList, Vector, Stack, etc. 
           Since all the subclasses implement the list, we can instantiate a list object with any of these classes
